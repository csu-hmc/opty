Local and global convergence properties of this method were analyzed in previous work. Here we provide a comprehensive description of the algorithm, including the feasibility restoration phase for the filter method, second-order corrections, and inertia correction of the KKT matrix. Heuristics are also considered that allow faster performance. This method has been implemented in the IPOPT code, which we demonstrate in a detailed numerical study based on 954 problems from the CUTEr test set. An evaluation is made of several line-search options, and a comparison is provided with two state-of-the-art interior-point codes for nonlinear programming.},

Our methods are based on pseudospectral approximations of the differential constraints that are assumed to be given in the form of controlled differential inclusions including the usual vector field and differential-algebraic forms. Discontinuities in states, controls, cost functional, dynamic constraints and various other mappings associated with the generalized Bolza problem are allowed by the concept of pseudospectral knots which we introduce in this paper. The computational optimal control problem is reduced to a structured sparse nonlinear programming problem. A simple but illustrative moon-landing problem demonstrates our method."

  abstract = { When designing sports equipment, it is often desirable to predict how certain design parameters will affect human performance. In many instances, this requires a consideration of human musculoskeletal mechanics and adaptive neuromuscular control. Current computational methods do not represent these mechanisms, and design optimization typically requires several iterations of prototyping and human testing. This paper introduces a computational method based on musculoskeletal modeling and optimal control, which has the capability to predict the effect of mechanical equipment properties on human performance. The underlying assumption is that users will adapt their neuromuscular control according to an optimality principle, which balances task performance with a minimization of muscular effort. The method was applied to the prediction of metabolic cost and limb kinematics while running and walking with weights attached to the body. A two-dimensional musculoskeletal model was used, with nine kinematic degrees of freedom and 16 muscles. The optimal control problem was solved for two walking speeds and two running speeds, and at each speed, with 200 g and 400 g masses placed at the thigh, knee, shank and foot. The model predicted an increase in energy expenditure that was proportional to the added mass and the effect was largest for a mass placed on the foot. Specifically, the model predicted an energy cost increase of 0.74\% for each 100 g mass added to the foot during running at 3.60 m/s. The model also predicted that stride length would increase by several millimetres in the same condition, relative to the model without added mass. These predictions were consistent with previously published human studies. Peak force and activation remained the same in most muscles, but increased by 26\% in the hamstrings and by 17\% in the rectus femoris for running at 4.27 m/s with 400 g added mass at the foot, suggesting muscle-specific training effects. This work demonstrated that a musculoskeletal model with optimal control can predict the effect of mechanical devices on human performance, and could become a useful tool for design optimization in sports engineering. The theoretical background of predictive simulation also helps explain why human athletes have specific responses when exercising in an altered mechanical environment. }

When applied to dynamic musculoskeletal models such optimality principles might be used to predict how a patient's gait adapts to mechanical interventions such as prosthetic devices or surgery. In this paper we study the effects of different performance criteria on predicted gait patterns using a 2D musculoskeletal model. The associated optimal control problem for a family of different cost functions was solved utilizing the direct collocation method. It was found that fatigue-like cost functions produced realistic gait, with stance phase knee flexion, as opposed to energy-related cost functions which avoided knee flexion during the stance phase. We conclude that fatigue minimization may be one of the primary optimality principles governing human gait.},

        Computer modeling, simulation and optimization are powerful tools that have seen increased use in biomechanics research. Dynamic optimizations can be categorized as either data-tracking or predictive problems. The data-tracking approach has been used extensively to address human movement problems of clinical relevance. The predictive approach also holds great promise, but has seen limited use in clinical applications. Enhanced software tools would facilitate the application of predictive musculoskeletal simulations to clinically-relevant research. The open-source software OpenSim provides tools for generating tracking simulations but not predictive simulations. However, OpenSim includes an extensive application programming interface that permits extending its capabilities with scripting languages such as MATLAB. In the work presented here, we combine the computational tools provided by MATLAB with the musculoskeletal modeling capabilities of OpenSim to create a framework for generating predictive simulations of musculoskeletal movement based on direct collocation optimal control techniques. In many cases, the direct collocation approach can be used to solve optimal control problems considerably faster than traditional shooting methods. Cyclical and discrete movement problems were solved using a simple 1 degree of freedom musculoskeletal model and a model of the human lower limb, respectively. The problems could be solved in reasonable amounts of time (several seconds to 1–2 hours) using the open-source IPOPT solver. The problems could also be solved using the fmincon solver that is included with MATLAB, but the computation times were excessively long for all but the smallest of problems. The performance advantage for IPOPT was derived primarily by exploiting sparsity in the constraints Jacobian. The framework presented here provides a powerful and flexible approach for generating optimal control simulations of musculoskeletal movement using OpenSim and MATLAB. This should allow researchers to more readily use predictive simulation as a tool to address clinical conditions that limit human mobility.

abstract = "Abstract The aim of this study was to perform full-body three-dimensional (3D) dynamic optimization simulations of human locomotion by driving a neuromusculoskeletal model toward in vivo measurements of body-segmental kinematics and ground reaction forces. Gait data were recorded from 5 healthy participants who walked at their preferred speeds and ran at 2m/s. Participant-specific data-tracking dynamic optimization solutions were generated for one stride cycle using direct collocation in tandem with an OpenSim-MATLAB interface. The body was represented as a 12-segment, 21-degree-of-freedom skeleton actuated by 66 muscle-tendon units. Foot-ground interaction was simulated using six contact spheres under each foot. The dynamic optimization problem was to find the set of muscle excitations needed to reproduce 3D measurements of body-segmental motions and ground reaction forces while minimizing the time integral of muscle activations squared. Direct collocation took on average 2.7±1.0h and 2.2±1.6h of CPU time, respectively, to solve the optimization problems for walking and running. Model-computed kinematics and foot-ground forces were in good agreement with corresponding experimental data while the calculated muscle excitation patterns were consistent with measured EMG activity. The results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing direct collocation on a detailed neuromusculoskeletal model with foot-ground contact to accurately and efficiently generate 3D data-tracking dynamic optimization simulations of human locomotion. The proposed method offers a viable tool for creating feasible initial guesses needed to perform predictive simulations of movement using dynamic optimization theory.

  abstract  = {Long term exposure to microgravity environment in spaceflight causes 
          some health issues such as space motion sickness, shift in body 
          fluids, muscle atrophy and bone demineralization. Studies have shown 
          that aerobics, and resistive exercise could help astronauts to deal 
          with the issues. Rowing exercise can provide both resistive and 
          aerobic exercise. A rowing exercise machine has mechanical parameters 
          which affect the user&#x2019;s movement and the loads on the 
          user&#x2019;s tissues. If these effects can be predicted, exercise 
          results can be improved. However, human testing is only possible on 
          Earth during the development, and also the absence of gravity may 
          affect the task execution in the space. Therefore, computational 
          modeling is necessary. In this thesis, a computational model of an 
          arm based on human musculoskeletal simulation and optimal control was 
          used to investigate the effects of mechanical properties of the 
         exercise machine on predicted human performance. Moreover, the other 
          goal was to study the effects of the exercise on arm motion and 
          tissue loads during the exercise. To explore this concept, we have 
          modeled a scaled down rowing exercise machine and a biceps mus- cle. 
          A system identification has been done on the Concept2 rowing machine 
          to determine baseline machine parameters. In order to solve the 
          problem, different methods in trajectory optimization were evaluated 
          to choose the reliable one. Then, a linear muscle force generator was 
          coupled to the rowing machine to examine how it performs the task. 
          The design parameters were changed to investigate their effects on 
          the movement. Finally, the simple muscle force generator was replaced 
          by a brachii muscle model to study how it executes the exercise. 
          Effects of the design elements were also studied.},

  abstract = {Solving an optimal control or estimation problem is not easy. Pieces of the puzzle are found scattered throughout many different disciplines. Furthermore, the focus of this book is on practical methods, that is, methods that I have found actually work! In fact everything described in this book has been implemented in production software and used to solve real optimal control problems. Although the reader should be proficient in advanced mathematics, no theorems are presented. Traditionally, there are two major parts of a successful optimal control or optimal estimation solution technique. The first part is the “optimization” method. The second part is the “differential equation” method. When faced with an optimal control or estimation problem it is tempting to simply “paste” together packages for optimization and numerical integration. While naive approaches such as this may be moderately successful, the goal of this book is to suggest that there is a better way! The methods used to solve the differential equations and optimize the functions are intimately related. The first two chapters of this book focus on the optimization part of the problem. In Chapter 1 the important concepts of nonlinear programming for small dense applications are introduced. Chapter 2 extends the presentation to problems which are both large and sparse. Chapters 3 and 4 address the differential equation part of the problem. Chapter 3 introduces relevant material in the numerical solution of differential (and differentialalgebraic) equations. Methods for solving the optimal control problem are treated in some detail in Chapter 4. Throughout the book the interaction between optimization and integration is emphasized. Chapter 5 describes how to solve optimal estimation problems. Chapter 6 presents a collection of examples that illustrate the various concepts and techniques. Real world problems often require solving a sequence of optimal control and/or optimization problems, and Chapter 7 describes a collection of these “advanced applications.” While the book incorporates a great deal of new material not covered in Practical Methods for Optimal Control Using Nonlinear Programming [21], it does not cover everything. Many important topics are simply not discussed in order to keep the overall presentation concise and focused. The discussion is general and presents a unified approach to solving optimal estimation and control problems. Most of the examples are drawn from my experience in the aerospace industry.

  annote =   {Dynamic optimisation consists in the determination, in open loop control, of a set of decision variable time profiles (pressure, temperature, flow rate, current, heat duty,~\ldots) for a dynamic system that optimise a given performance index (or cost functional or optimisation criterion)(cost, time, energy, selectivity,~\ldots) subject to specified constraints (safety, environmental and operating constraints). Optimal control refers to the determination of the best time-varying profiles in closed loop control. The orthogonal collocations on finite elements has been developed and implemented within MATLAB environment. The original dynamic optimisation problem is then converted into an NLP problem which is solved using an SQP solver. The gradients of the performance index as well as of the constraints with respect to the parameters are computed numerically and analytically. Six different examples from the literature are considered and treated. The results confirm the optimal values of the literature and the expected performances of the optimisation method when the gradients are computed analytically.},
