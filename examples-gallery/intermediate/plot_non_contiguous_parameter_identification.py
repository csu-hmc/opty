Parameter Identification from Noncontiguous Measurements
========================================================

In parameter estimation it is common to collect measurements of a system's
trajectories from distinct experiments. For example, if you are identifying the
parameters of a mass-spring-damper system, you may excite the system with
different initial conditions multiple times and measure the position of the
mass. The data cannot simply be stacked end-to-end in time and the
identification run because the measurement data would be discontinuous between
each measurement trial.

A workaround in opty is to create a set of differential equations with unique
state variables for each measurement trial that all share the same constant
parameters. You can then identify the parameters from all measurement trials
simultaneously by passing the uncoupled differential equations to opty.

Mass-spring-damper Example
==========================

The position of a simple system consisting of a mass connected to a fixed point
by a spring and a damper is simulated and recorded as noisy measurements. The
spring constant and the damping coefficient will be identified.

**State Variables**

- :math:`x_1`: position of the mass of the first measurement trial [m]
- :math:`x_2`: position of the mass of the second measurement trial [m]
- :math:`x_3`: position of the mass of the third measurement trial [m]
- :math:`x_4`: position of the mass of the fourth measurement trial [m]
- :math:`u_1`: speed of the mass of the first measurement trial [m/s]
- :math:`u_2`: speed of the mass of the second measurement trial [m/s]
- :math:`u_3`: speed of the mass of the third measurement trial [m/s]
- :math:`u_4`: speed of the mass of the fourth measurement trial [m/s]

**Parameters**

- :math:`m`: mass [kg]
- :math:`c`: linear damping coefficient [Ns/m]
- :math:`k`: linear spring constant [N/m]
- :math:`l_0`: natural length of the spring [m]
