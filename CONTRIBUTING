Patches to the software are welcomed. Authors retain copyright of patches but
release under the same license as opty on merge. It is preferable to submit
patches as Github pull requests. There are no guidelines for issues and pull
requests. Feel free to copy guidelines and patterns from other popular open
source Python packages.

The opty documentation can be found at http://opty.readthedocs.org.

Any questions, concerns, bug reports, etc should be submitted as Github issues.

Be nice :)
